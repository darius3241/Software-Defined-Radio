# Software-Defined-Radio
This project is a quadrature sampling down converter software defined radio reciver for Engineering Electronics II at Walla Walla University

## Design Objectives
Our professor, [Dr. Rob Frohne](https://github.com/frohro), gave us the following design objectives:
  1. Minimum discernible signal less than 1 uV
  2. Good image rejection
  3. Low noise figure
  4. Inexpensive to build ($25 component budget)
  
  1. **Simple Design**: We wanted our design to be easy to understand and construct. As such we avoided using transformers and used a Tayloe Mixer which has a relatively easy to understand design.
  2. **Ease of Construction**: We wanted to build a simple radio that works. So we limited are components to basic parts to ensure we have a better chance of getting it to work! 
  3. **Low Cost**: Our budget for this project was $30
  

## Overview
The Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver connects to an antenna and covers the filtering, mixing, and amplification of the desired signal. It then connects a sound card within a computer and software handles the demodulation of the signal into playable audio. The mixing is handled using an Arduino Nano running code provided to us by our Professor, [Dr. Rob Frohne](https://github.com/frohro), which interfaces with [Quisk](https://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/), an SDR that controls the receiver through the Arduino. Using Quisk, the radio can be tuned to a certain frequency by adjusting the speed of the local oscillator used in the mixing process. Our budget on this project to keep with the low-cost aspect was about $30 including fabrication of the PCB and the required components. 

# Theory
![Circuit Block Diagram](/images/Diagrams/SDRReceiverBlockDiagram.png)
The basics of the SDR Receiver are shown above in the block diagram, with the blue components being defined by software. An antenna picks up the radio signal and passes it through a bandpass filter. This filter will attenuate any signals outside our desired range of 5 â€“ 10 MHz. This is then passed through a Tayloe Mixer, also known as the Tayloe Quadrature Product Detector. The Tayloe Mixer is a simple and efficient mixer that uses a 1:4 demultiplexer and operational amplifiers to generate the I and Q quadrature signals for demodulation. After the signal has been split into four bandbase signals, they are amplified and combined into the I and Q quadrature signals. Those signals go through a final Low-Pass filter that will attenuate signals above 100KHz in frequency, effectively smoothing the output signal. This signal is then sent via 3.5mm audio cable to the soundcard which demodulates the signal. Quisk can then read the input from the sound card and play it. Quisk also interfaces to the Arduino Nano to set the speed of the local oscillator for tuning into the desired frequency.
